### About

Colorant is a highly efficient color aimbot designed to rapidly scan for a range of purple color of the valorant enemy player outlines on your screen and precisely aim/shoot at it, without any interference with the game memory or files of Valorant.

Unlike conventional video game cheats that rely on the process memory to function, Colorant adopt a unique approach by avoiding any memory reading altogether. This innovative approach has the potential to remain undetectable by anti-cheat mechanisms that typically attempt to block memory reads. Additionally, sending input to the video game without triggering any flags can be a challenging aspect to consider.

The primary objective of this project is to showcase a proof of concept, demonstrating the potential of Colorant's novel approach to aimbot technology.

## Getting started

#### You will need the following prerequisites:
- [ESP 32](https://www.amazon.com/Arduino-org-A000057-Arduino-Leonardo-Headers/dp/B008A36R2Y)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)

# Helper - Installation Assistant for All Components
1. Python 3.11.6 is required for automatic installation. [Download](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.6/python-3.11.6-amd64.exe).
   - Make sure to check the `Add Python 3.11.6 to PATH` box before installation.

2. Restart your computer (optional).
3. Download the repository and extract it, for example, to your desktop.

4. Navigate to the folder you extracted and run `py helper.py`.
5. The script will first check the installed components necessary for the update.
6. Next, you will see buttons in the menu. First, download and install CUDA, Torch then TensorRT.
7. Without exiting the program, you can check functionality using the `Test detections` button.
8. Everything should be ready.
9. All issues and errors can be found on the official [Discord server](https://discord.gg/sunone).
